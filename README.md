# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**tip_calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Sergio Puleri**

Time spent: **8-10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Created a custom slide out menu drawer
- [X] Functionality to save recent totals, along with tip amount, bill amount, and date which is shown in a new table view
- [X] Settings option to turn on or turn off the save totals functionality
- [X] Use of NSUserDefaults to store serialized saved totals.

## Notes

Most challengeing part was building the slide out menu, since I had to learn about UI Kit Dynamics. It ended up looking really cool and I learned alot.
